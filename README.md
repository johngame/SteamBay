A Gamer lists an Virtual Steam item on SteamBay, most anything from Dota2,CSGO,TF2,Steam Items.

The seller chooses to accept only bids for the item (an auction-type listing) or to offer the Buy It Now option, which allows Gamers to purchase the item right away at a fixed price.

In an online auction, the bidding opens at a price the seller specifies and remains on SteamBay for a certain number of days. Gamers then place bids on the item. When the listing ends, the Gamer with the highest bid wins.

In a Buy It Now listing, the first Gamer willing to pay the seller's price gets the item.
